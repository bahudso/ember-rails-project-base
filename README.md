# Ember Rails Project Base

This project is used as a base for many of my Ember.js & Rails projects.

## Backend
The rails project implements the backend server application. It runs devise for user authentication. It has been configured for ember-simple-auth as described [here](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-simple-auth/tree/master/packages/ember-simple-auth-devise).

### Versions
* [Rails 4.1.6](https://github.com/rails/rails)
* [Devise 3.4.0](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)

## Frontend
The Ember.js frontend uses [ember-cli-simple-auth-devise](https://github.com/simplabs/ember-cli-simple-auth-devise) for local session management.
